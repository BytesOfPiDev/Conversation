Installation
===============

The gem is available as a `gem repository <https://docs.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/gems/repositories/overview/>`_.

To install it, add the following gem repository to your project manager: 

  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BytesOfPiDev/bop-gems/main`

Alternatively, you may clone the `Conversation repository <https://github.com/BytesOfPiDev/Conversation>`_ and then 
`register <https://docs.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/project-config/register-gems/>`_ it with O3DE.

.. Note:: Installation via the repository still needs to be tested.
